### This is a dummy directory to create the translation

Th use the translation:update de --force command you need to copy here 
the messages+intl-icu.de.xlf file and then make the command.
After this you need to copy the messages+intl-icu.de.xlf file from the this directory back to the translation directory.

This workaroud is neccessary until symfony make the paths variable in translytion setting overwrite the default_path variable.
