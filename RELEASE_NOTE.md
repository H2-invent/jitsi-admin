# Release Notes - Version 0.77.x 

## New Features:
- **Default End-to-End Encryption (E2E):** We are thrilled to introduce the ability to enable End-to-End Encryption by default for enhanced security and privacy. Now, each server can individually configure this feature, giving you control over the level of encryption applied to your communications.

This ensures a more immersive videoconference experience by maximizing the display area, making your meetings more engaging and effective.
    - set `LAF_SHOW_TAG_TRANSPARENT_BACKGROUND=1` to show the tags in the conference with a transparent background
