# Release Notes - Version 0.77.x 

## New Features:
- **Default End-to-End Encryption (E2E):** We are thrilled to introduce the ability to enable End-to-End Encryption by default for enhanced security and privacy. Now, each server can individually configure this feature, giving you control over the level of encryption applied to your communications.

- **Transparent Background for Videoconference Tags:** In response to your feedback, we've added a new feature that allows you to set tags in videoconferences with a transparent background. This ensures a more immersive videoconference experience by maximizing the display area, making your meetings more engaging and effective.
