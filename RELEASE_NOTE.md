## New Features:
- Start/Pause Function in a Multiframe: Users can now start and stop conferences in a multiframe, providing more control over conference management.
- Automatic Pause of Conferences: When there are two conferences running simultaneously, the top conference will be active while all other conferences will automatically pause. This ensures efficient utilization of resources.
- Redesigned UI/UX: The user interface and user experience have been completely redesigned to enhance usability and visual appeal. Check out the new look in the screenshots below:
